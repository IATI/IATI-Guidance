Updating your data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you have initially published your first data sets you need to ensure that they are updated regularly. In addition, things may change over time and this section therefore includes instructions for the most common changes that a publisher might need to make.



Regularly Updating Your Datafiles
=================================

Once an organisation has committed to publish to IATI, it is most important that their data files are updated regularly and in line with the frequency as specified in a publisher's IATI Registry account. 

Publishers should NOT create additional new files that only contain the most recent information each time they publish. Ideally all the information that relates to a specific activity should be kept together as much as is possible as this makes the ultimate use of the data by any third party much more efficient. Data should be cumulative (e.g. if publishing every quarter, the new files will include the quarter being reported on, and the previous quarter reported last time, and so on). It will also enable amendments to be made to existing data.

No data should ever be removed or deleted from published files. It is intended that one published data remains permanently available.

You will need to refer to the specific guidance of the tool that you are using to publish in order to find out how to update pre-existing datasets




Change Of Organisation IATI Contact
===================================

As people frequently change job it is quite common that the nominated point of contact for IATI within an organisation will change over time. When this occurs please contact the IATI Technical Support Team by emailing us at support@iatistandard.org to let us know the name of the new contact so that we can update our records accordingly.

In addition, the name of the IATI point of contact should be updated in the following accounts (where appropriate):
 
1) Aidstream 
2) CSV Converter
3) IATI Registry (check your user account, publisher account and datafiles for contacts details)




Changing A Publisher Name
=========================

If an organisation has essentially become a new organisation eg. it has merged with another organisations and/or has re-registered with its regulating body then the following steps should be followed. 

1) The publisher should determine if a new IATI Organisation Identifier is required and if it is what the new IATI Organisation Identifier will be.
2) The publisher should contact the IATI Technical Support Team to let them know that the organisation has changed its name, its proposed new IATI Organisation Identifier and what action they are intending to take regarding their published IATI files and by when?
3) The publisher should update any of their new or existing published IATI files to use the new IATI Organisation Identifier if appropriate.
4) The publisher should create a new registry publisher account in the name of the new organisation (including specifying the new IATI Organisation Identifier).
5) When The IATI Technical Support Team receives the notification to approve the new Registry account, the 'old' Registry account is set to a status of 'Pending' at the same time the new account is approved
6) Once the publisher receives notification that the new Registry account has been approved they should (re)publish their (updated) files to the new account
7) The IATI Technical Support Team will arrange for redirects from the old datasets to be set up so that any third party users of the organisation's datafiles will be able to find the new files.
8) The IATI Technical Support Team will arrange for the 'old' Registry account and files to be deleted one month after the new files have been published.


If an organisation has simply rebranded or has not changed their legal status then the following steps should be carried out:

1) The publisher should review all the information specified in their IATI Registry account and update any details as appropriate
2) As part of the Registry account review in 1) the publisher should decide if they want to change their Registry Publisher ID to something that more closely matches their new name. If the publisher does decide to change their Publisher ID then they should carry out the remaining steps otherwise no further action is required.
3) The publisher should contact the IATI Technical Support Team to let them know that the organisation has changed its name and is intending to update its Publisher ID and by when?
4) The publisher should delete all existing datafiles from the existing publisher account
5) The publisher should update the Registry Publisher ID (NB if publishing via Aidstream then the publisher id in 'Setting's should also be updated to the new Registry ID as wll as updaing the organisation Aidstream profile details)
6) The publisher should re-publish their datafiles to the updated Registry account
7) The IATI Technical Support Team will arrange for redirects from the old datasets to be set up so that any third party users of the organisation's datafiles will be able to find the new files.
