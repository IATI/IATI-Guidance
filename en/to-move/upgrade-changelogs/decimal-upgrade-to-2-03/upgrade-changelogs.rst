Upgrade changelogs
==================

Standard Upgrades
-----------------

The IATI standard is a living entity that requires improvement over time. The elements, attributes, rules and core codelist values can only be amended, added or removed during a formal upgrade.

More details about upgrades can be found here (add in link).

The following pages list out the timeframes for the previous upgrades to the IATI Standard, a changelog of the changes made and links to the public discussions had for each change.

Non-core codelists
------------------

The only part of the Standard which can be updated outside of a formal upgrade are non-core codelists (add in link). These codelists are not version specific and additions or modifications have minor impact on already published data.

Often these codeslits replicate other codelist providers. IATI will keep the codelits up to date and log all changes made to a codelist e.g. when the ISO Country Codelist updated the country name Swaziland to eSwatini.

A changelog of the non-core codelists is available here (add in link).
