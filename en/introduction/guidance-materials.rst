Guidance materials
==================

Definition
----------
The **IATI Standard** can be adopted and utilised by a wide variety of organisations, ranging in context, scale, scope and focus.

Whilst core documentation on the Standard focuses on general definitions, guidance materials are designed to provide specific instructions.  

In some cases, this may be applicable to different kinds of organisations, all with diverse needs. 


Considerations
--------------

* The current focus of Guidance materials is on the mechanisms and processes to publish IATI data
