Publish Your Datafiles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To publish your files you need to carry out the following: 


Validate Your IATI Files Using The IATI Validator
=================================================

The IATI Validator tool at http://validator.iatistandard.org/ will currently check your files for two things:

- That it contains only valid XML
- That it only uses elements as defined in the relevant version of the IATI Standard

If errors are found you should investigate the error(s) and amend your data and recreate your files before re-validating to make sure that any problems have been fixed.


Move Your IATI Files to Your Own Web Servers 
============================================

Once your files have been validated and contain no errors you should move them to the location identified for them (see 3.6)  on your own web servers. 

if you have created and published your files via Aidstream then you will need to consult the Aidstream guide for instructions on how to locate and move your files from Aidstream to your own servers

f you have created and published your files via the CSV Convertor then you will need to consult the CSV Converter guide for instructions on how to locate and  move your files from Aidstream to your own servers

 
Create An IATI Registry Account
==================================

Each publishing organisation must create a Registry account in order to register its data. There are four steps involved:

1. Register as a user
2. Create a New Publisher Account
3. Wait for your Publisher Account to be authorised by the IATI Secretariat
4. Register your datafiles

1. Register as a user
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Submit your details at http://iatiregistry.org/user/register.

2. Create a New Publisher Account
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Make sure that you are (still?) logged into the user account created in 1. and navigate to “Create a New Publisher” on the “Publishers” menu. (This item will not display if you are not logged in.) Please fill in all the fields on the form following the advice associated with each field. There is a lot of data to provide but much of it can be found in your Implementation Schedule if you have created one.

3. Wait for the Publisher Account to be authorised?
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

This ensures that no-one can use the Registry to publish data purporting to come from an organisation that they are not authorised to represent. You will receive an email notifying you when the account has been authorised.

4. Add Details of Your Datafiles
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Once your publisher account has been authorised, log into it and select the 'Add Datafile' option in order to add the details and URL location of your IATI datafiles that you are publishing.
