**Live Operational Data â€“ Handle with Care!**

IATI is one of the emerging success stories of transparency and open data. More and more data on development cooperation and humanitarian aid is becoming available every day: much of it in IATI-XML format. But creating meaningful, usable and accessible information from raw data is not always as simple as it appears.

The Datastore is not a curated database. The content comes from over 170 organisations with differing resources, information policies and quality control. It is updated daily and while quality generally improves it can also deteriorate.

Adding numbers together is easy. Drawing proper conclusions from your actions needs a bit more thought. Before diving into this data please read these notes and bear them in mind.
