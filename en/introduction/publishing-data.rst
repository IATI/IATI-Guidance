Publishing Data
===============

Definition
----------
| In publishing data to IATI, organisations commit to providing data that is accessible, useful and useable for a range of actors, particularly in developing countries. 
| 
| To ensure this, publishers are expected to provide data that meets the following characteristics:

* Valid.
* Comprehensive.
* Timely.
* Historic.
* Forward-looking.
* Available openly.


Considerations
--------------

* **Valid**:

	* When data is valid, it means that it is formatted correctly.
	* In the IATI Standard, data is validated against the schema and codelists.
	* It also sits within the constraints that are laid out in the rulesets.
	* When data is valid, it will be well-formed XML that can be used with other data published in the IATI format.

* **Comprehensive**:

	* When data is comprehensive, it provides all relevant fields as outlined in the Standard, and covers as many development cooperation activities as possible.
	* Organisations can state the scope and scale of their IATI publication in an Implementation Schedule.
	* Exclusions and redactions can be made for a variety of reasons.
	* When data is comprehensive, users of information can gain a more holistic picture of the extent of development cooperation happening in different locations around the world.

* **Timely**:

	* When data is timely, a publisher is providing the most recently available data possible, within the organisational process.
	* IATI has a variety of timescales for within which an organisation can choose to update their information.

* **Historic**:

	* When data is historic, it means that it is not lost or replaced over time.
	* IATI data does not serve as a snapshot, but as an historic record of activities.
	* Access to historical information enables users to monitor changes in development cooperation activities more easily.

* **Forward-looking**:

	* Forward-looking data is data that reflects planned or projected values of projects.
	* In IATI, planned budgets for countries, activities or the organisation as a whole are some of the most common forward-looking elements.
	* Results can also include forward-looking targets.
	* Forward-looking information can be particularly valuable for governments in developing countries who need this information to budget and plan effectively. 

* **Availabile**:

	* In the IATI context, available data is data that is accessible and open for users.
	* The IATI Standard does not host data.  It is the responsibility of publishers to maintain and publish their data in an accessible way.
	* Accessible data should be physically available for users to find and use, but also appropriately licenced.
	* When data is accessible, it is easier for users to locate it and make use of it.
