Regularly Updating Your Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you have initially published your first data sets you need to ensure that they are updated. 


Updating Your Datafiles
=======================

The most important point about publishing regularly is to ensure that your data files are updated rather than creating additional new files every time you publish that only contain the most recent information. Ideally you need to try and keep all the information that relates to a specific activity together as much as you can as this will make the ultimate use of your data by any third party much more efficient.

You will need to refer to the specific guidance of the tool that you are using to publish in order to  find out how to update pre-existing datasets
