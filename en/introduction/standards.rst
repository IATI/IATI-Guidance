The organisation & activity standards
=====================================

Definition
----------

The **IATI Standard** requires publication of data about both the organisation and development cooperation activities carried out by the organisation:

* The **Organisation Standard** is used to describe an organisation involved in any stage development cooperation (funding, implementing etc.).

* The **Activity Standard** is used to describe the details of individual development cooperation activities/projects.


Considerations
--------------

* Organisations publishing to IATI, should aim to make data available at both organisation and activity levels.

| Both the **Organisation Standard** and **Activity Standard** sections of this documentation include the following:

* Overview: an introduction to key aspects of both the organisation and activity standards.
* Examples - fully worked examples of both standards, expressed as both IATI XML and in a table with descriptions. 
* Element pages: details on each and every element and attribute of the standards, with links to relevant code lists and rulesets.
