Establish Publishing Policies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Once your organisation has committed to IATI publishing and the project team or IATI Champion is in place decisions need to be made about what, how and when data will be published. 
This information should be initially recorded on the 'Publishing Information' tab of the Implementation Schedule and then copied into the relevant fields of the Publisher's Registry account when it is created.




The Implementation Schedule
===========================

The purpose of the Implementation Schedule is to:

- Document an organisation's publishing policies to provide context to its published datafiles
- Provide the time line for when data for each field of the IATI Standard was / will be published (or not published if not applicable / possible etc.)
- Enable the IATI Secretariat to confirm that an organisation is delivering on its publishing commitment.

The Implementation Schedule (currently in MS Excel format) is a living document and should ideally be subject to the version control. It can be updated and added to at any time, to reflect changes or additions to the way an organisation is reporting. 
 
The drafting of the Implementation Schedule can be done in parallel with preparing data for publication and it should also be published along side the IATI data. Whilst the Implementation Schedule is not a mandatory document to create (unless of course there is a contractual requirement attached to funding to produce one), it is strongly recommended that it is used in order to aid the publisher in publishing their data.

What Will Be Your Activity Unit of Aid? 
=======================================

One of the most important decisions to be taken before you start implementing IATI is to decide how to present your particular business model in a way in which your work is best translated into an IATI activity. It is up to you to define your units of aid and you can specify any number of hierarchical levels in which to best organise your activities. Your work might, for example, be broken into themes, programmes, projects, sub-projects and/or contracts. It is up to you to decide whether a hierarchical structure best tells the story of your organisation, or whether such a framework is irrelevant to the data that IATI is asking you to report.It is important to define what the unit of aid being reported is. Organisations use a range of different definitions or may have different ways of identifying an 'activity'. Examples of units of aid include: programmes, projects, sub-projects, activities, grants, etc.

If Units of Aid are defined via a hierarchy, an explanation needs to be provided on how the units of aid are split between the hierarchy levels. For example, activities at hierarchy level 1 (or the parent level) could cover things like programmes, umbrella projects or grant streams. Units of aid at hierarchy level 2 (or 'child' level) could include projects or sub-projects. It is also possible for activities to be related on a horizontal basis ('siblings'). For example, a group of projects sitting under a programme could be classed as sibling activities. Related activities can be identified through providing the related activity identifiers when reporting on each individual activity.

It is also important to differentiate what data will appear at the different levels. For example, activity budgets could be reported at level 1, while transaction level data is reported at level 2. This also helps to avoid double counting, with monetary amounts being reported at the lowest possible hierarchical level (and not repeated or aggregated at higher levels). Lower level activities will inherit data from their parent activity.
 
 
 

Publishing Frequency
=====================

Organisations typically publish updates annually, every 6 months, quarterly, monthly and even daily. Ideally IATI would want every publisher to publish as frequently as their information changes. However, IATI recognises that this is not always possible so it encourages publishers to select the most frequent publishing frequently that their organisation is able to support.




Data Timeliness
===============

Timeliness of data relates to how current the data is when it is published. IATI differs from other reporting standards and systems, by emphasising the importance of publishing timely data, that is reflective of the swift-changing nature of projects and activities. With this comes a tension between provision of timely data and quality data.

If you are publishing quarterly do you include transactions that have occurred right up to the day that you publish your information or are your most recent transaction those that occurred a month or so in the past? Timeliness is normally constrained to the accessibility and functioning of an organization's own accounting processes and systems. 




Data Quality
============

it is important to consider how accurate your data is when it is published. The data published does not need to be audited in the same way as would be done with close of year accounts. However, ultimately, the decision on data quality will be taken by each individual organisation, depending on the internal procedures and processes that data may have to go through before being put in the public domain. It will also depend on whether an organisation approaches IATI as an open data initiative or a process for publishing verified statistics. Many organisations publish information taken from unaudited accounts throughout the year that is then revised and republished once the accounts have been through the audit process. If data is initially published in an unvalidated or estimated format it is important to consider how and when your data can be recreated and published in its formalised format.

Publishers should also outline the quality assurance processes or any details of their considerations around what they consider to be verified or unverified data, and where their IATI data sits on that scale.




Thresholds
==========

If applicable, some organisations may need to establish thresholds in terms of the value of activities or transactions that they are publishing. For example, an organisation who works on large projects costing thousands of dollars may wish only to publish projects over a particular value (for example $500).

Similarly, if an organisation generally only makes or receives transactions over a particular value, they may wish to aggregate all transactions, in-coming or out-going that are under a particular value, per organisation, per publication period.

As with exclusions, information on thresholds should be clearly published in order to help users of the data understand the context it is being published in.




Exclusions
==========

IATI enables publishers of information to the Standard to exclude certain information from their data. However IATI requires that the policy of how those exclusions are made is made public, as part of the Registry Record in order to provide context to those who are using the data. Reasons for needing to exclude data depend on each organisation but can vary from security concerns to the need to protect commercial information. If your organisation carries out works which could be considered by others as controversial or unethical eg. providing family planning services to people who live in catholic countries, education of girls within cultures that are seen as oppressive to women etc.,  you may not want to publish all the details of your work in order to both protect those who are doing the work as well as the intervention itself. Similarly if you are working in sensitive geographic areas you may not wish to publish details of your work and the areas in which it is taken place. In such circumstances you can elect to only publish minimal details or even to not publish any details at all.

Considerations when defining an exclusion policy

- Does your organisation/government have any existing Freedom of Information laws or policies that may impact the IATI exclusion policy?
- Are there particular data fields where you would consistently have to remove data?
- Are there entire programmes/activities that would need to be excluded from your IATI data?




Publishing Scope
================

Each organisation needs to understand where it sits within the aid delivery supply chain and report accordingly. Basically an organisation should report on activities for which they either receive payments or make payments for or are directly involved in in some other way




Which Aid Activities Should Be Included
=======================================

As its name suggests IATI is about Aid Transparency. However, it is not just about publishing data for ODA activities. Information can be published about any activity which falls under any of the aid categories as defined at http://iatistandard.org/codelists/flow_type/ .

Consideration should also be given to which specific aid activities are reported on. Ideally IATI would want details of all of an organisation's aid activities to be published and not just those that have funding which comes with a contractual requirement to publish.




Where Will You Publish Your IATI Datafiles? 
===============================================

When you publish your information you do not give your information to IATI to look after. You will instead create an account on the IATI Registry that will hold (along with other information) the URL of where your IATI files are located. IATI therefore asks its publishers to host the datafiles that contain their IATI information on their own web servers. This is because data that is located within a publisher's own web space has greater integrity due to it being located at source. Therefore you will probably need to work with your IT or web team in order to identify a location where your IATI information can be hosted. If you have decided to create an IATI specific web page it is a good idea to include links to your published IATI files?




Licensing 
=========

Background
>>>>>>>>>>

The success of IATI is dependent on intermediaries making information accessible for different stakeholders by taking the information published for the IATI information providers and using it to produce databases, tools, applications, and analysis for newspaper articles or radio programmes, etc. It is envisaged that these intermediaries would range from partner country governments, CSOs in the north and south, community groups, parliamentarians, journalists, individuals, researchers.

To enable this ecosystem of different ways of accessing information, intermediaries must be given legal permission to use it. This can be done on a case-by-case basis, where each time someone wants to use the information they must ask for a license from the copyright owner, or a license can be issued up front that states the terms for using the information. For practical reasons, as well as to encourage the use of the information, it has been agreed that IATI will seek to proactively license the information. In addition, in the case of IATI, where information is provided by multiple sources it is particularly important that the licenses used are compatible with each other.

In parallel with the IATI process, there is a movement towards open government and open data movements within international organisations. There are strong links between the goals of these initiatives and IATI, and the principles of open data (as defined by the open knowledge definition1) are a key element for all of them. For data and databases, to be “open” means that users have the ability to:

1) combine (mash up) datasets from different providers;
2) add additional data and select which data records to include or exclude in derived works;
3) change the organisation of the data (its schema) and change the database to a different format;
4) copy and distribute the information.
5) The TAG Secretariat, in collaboration with a small group chaired by the World Bank and including an open data/intellectual property lawyer, produced a set of recommendations for licensing. The IATI Licensing Standard, agreed in February 2011 at a meeting of signatories and the IATI Steering Committee, is that information published through the IATI standard should be licensed under an open license. It is a set of principles that must be adhered to, rather than a prescriptive set of terms and conditions.

Open Aid Information Licensing Standard
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

This Open Aid Information (OAI) Licensing Standard helps encourage the use and reuse of aid information to help provide better, and more effective, aid to those who receive it. The OAI Licensing Standard is the result of work by the IATI Secretariat in collaboration with governments, NGOs, international organisations, lawyers, and open knowledge experts from around the world. This OAI Licensing Standard is deliberately worded in sufficiently general terms that it could be used for any type of aid-related information, not just for information published to the IATI Standard.

Summary of the standard
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Open Aid Information compliant with this Standard

- must be public domain or licensed under an attribution-only open license (the “legal tools”) [Element 1];
- the legal tools used must be appropriate for data [Element 3];
- Intellectual Property (IP) Policies related to the Open Aid Information must be in plain language and easily accessible to users [Element 4].

This Standard strongly recommends that Open Aid Information:

- Should use a recognised and established open public license appropriate for databases [Element 2];
- Should include FAQs and licensing help by the aid information publishers whenever possible [Element 5].

What is open aid information?
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
This standard concerns open aid information. But what is open aid information?

By open we mean open as in the Open (Knowledge) Definition — in essence information (data and documents) is open if it can be freely used, reused and redistributed by anyone.
By aid information we mean data and information on aid flows by both official and private providers of development assistance (inc. NGOs and Foundations)

Element 1: 
>>>>>>>>>>
Aid information must be published under public domain waivers or attribution-only open licenses as defined by the Open Knowledge Definition.

The goal is for aid information to be effectively used and added to by others as widely as possible.  Therefore the use of licenses which limit commercial re-use or limit the production of derivative works by excluding use for particular purposes or by specific persons or organisations is discouraged. These restrictive licenses make it impossible to effectively integrate and re-purpose datasets and prevent commercial activities that could be used to support preservation and innovation with aid information. As a result, we have selected the Open Knowledge Definition as our standard for openness for aid information as it provides for a stable, accepted, legal standard of openness used in multiple fields.

Further, we want to make aid information as widely usable as possible, even within the context of the Open Knowledge Definition (OKD). Therefore we limit OKD-compliant licenses to those that place aid information into the public domain (also known as dedications or waivers [2]) and those that (at most) require attribution of source. Share-alike clauses [1] for aid information are specifically prohibited under this Standard, as they can cause “license silos” by preventing legal interoperability even between other openly licensed material — because they require the use of only that share-alike license.

We therefore recommend and limit open aid information compliant with this Standard as:

- Public domain – no copyright, database rights, or contractual rights over the open aid information. [3] Examples include Creative Commons’ CC0 tool and the Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License (PDDL); OR
Attribution-only open licenses – licenses that allow for use and reuse, with the only restriction being that attribution (credit) be given. Examples include the Creative Commons Attribution licenses (CC-BY) and the Open Data Commons Attribution License.
- Public domain approaches are preferred for aid information.

We strongly recommend that aid information, especially where the result of public funding, be explicitly placed in the public domain. This is to better serve democracy, transparency, and greater public participation. We understand that this is not always possible or preferable for publishers, and thus an open license requiring only attribution to the source is provided as an alternative.Publishing aid information in the public domain complies with related open data initiatives, including the Panton Principles, and the Science Commons Protocol for Implementing Open Access Data.  Public domain still means that in many academic disciplines and in other contexts that users will voluntarily follow established social norms of citation and attribution. Social and academic norms can still apply.

Notes:

This standard applies to aid information, and so does allow for some restrictions, such as for non-aid information and for technical reasons, such as:

Technical restrictions on use of web services (such as limiting the number of calls per hour via an API).
Any type of disclaimer of warranties.
“No endorsement” language and separate (non-open) policies for any trademarks or reserved symbols.
[1] Also known as copyleft or reciprocal licensing clauses. Share Alike licenses do comply with the Open Knowledge Definition, but as noted would not comply with this standard.

[2] Copyright vests automatically, and so giving up rights over a work in copyright before they expire (due to end of the term) requires a special tool known as a dedication to the public domain or a waiver of rights. Licenses in this context depend on an underlying copyright to function.

[3] Databases compatible with the Science Commons Protocol for Implementing Open Access Data and the Panton Principles will fulfil this requirement.

Licenses: Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License (PDDL); Creative Commons CC0 tool or Public Domain certification; Open Data Commons Attribution License (ODC-BY); Creative Commons Attribution License (CC-BY)


Element 2: 
>>>>>>>>>>
Aid information publishers should use recognised public domain waivers or open licenses.

Making use of recognised open licenses and waivers (together, “legal tools”) helps encourage the greatest use and reuse of aid information by tapping into already existing online communities built around these legal tools. [4] This greatly helps use and reuse as recipients of open aid information don’t have to continually learn new legal terms — they can learn how one legal tool works and apply it across multiple sources of open aid information.

In economic terms, using an established and widely used open license or waiver lowers the transaction costs for users of aid information and by doing so can increase uptake by the community and increase understanding and therefore compliance with the licenses. For aid information publishers, using an established legal tool means not having to hire lawyers to draft, maintain, and update a specialist legal document.

In simple terms, using recognised tools makes it easier on everyone, including both publishers and users.

[4] Providers of open licenses with recognised communities are often referred to as “Public licensing bodies”. For more information, see http://www.jordanhatcher.com/2010/open-licenses-vs-public-licenses/


Element 3: 
>>>>>>>>>>
The legal tools used must be appropriate for data.

Aid information published under this initiative will often be data and databases. Many widely recognised licenses are not intended for, and are not appropriate for, data or collections of data (databases). We recommend using legal tools specifically tailored for data for the publication of aid information. The two key elements:

Legal – the legal tool must clearly cover the rights over data — including copyright, database rights, and contract — while taking into account the global networked environment and the many different legal jurisdictions involved. Many content or software licenses don’t include database rights, for example.
Practical – particularly for open licenses requiring attribution, the legal tools must take into account the practical questions that often come up in a database environment in complying with the license terms, such as how and when to attribute the source.
If a legal tool meets these two elements, generally it can be safe for use for aid information compliant with this standard.


Element 4:    
>>>>>>>>>>
IP Policies related to aid information must be in plain language and easily accessible to users.

Publishers should make use of plain language and should highlight their IP policies to users accessing aid information in order to make it as easy as possible for users to access, read, and understand the rights that they have to use, reuse, and redistribute the aid information.


Element 5: 
>>>>>>>>>>
Publishers should include FAQs and licensing help whenever possible.

In order to further help facilitate understanding of their rights and obligations under the license, publishers and IATI itself should publish detailed FAQs and related licensing help resources. As part of the work behind this Standard, IATI will build the materials and resources available to both publishers and users to learn more about Open Aid Information.

Licensing is important in an open data initiative. Ensuring that your IATI data is appropriately licensed is a key part of publishing IATI data and there are some considerations to be made when choosing and writing a license. 

- Review the existing licenses or legal conditions regarding data sharing within an organisation.
- Consult the IATI Standard requirements for licensing data, and decide which is most appropriate for the organisation.
- Refer to templates available for IATI licenses, and manipulate to suit specific organisational needs.
- Consult with the IATI TAG Secretariat or a licensing specialist if you are uncertain whether the license you have created is IATI compliant.

Licensing of your data is maintained within the information held on your IATI Registry account.
