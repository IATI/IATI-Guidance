The Case For Publishing
=======================

IATI aims to make information easier to access, use and understand for all stakeholders who require information about development assistance as defined by its mission.

However, there are other reasons why an organisation or agency might decide to publish IATI data. These are:

Improving the organisation’s external profile – by committing to IATI, organisations and governments are more accountable to their audiences (tax payers or members of the public), by sharing more information on their activities.

Improving organisational processes and systems – Some organisations become more effective. By improving the data they are publishing to external stakeholders they often identify gaps or duplication in their information management processes. 

Publishing better data to improve planning processes – Publishing better data on projects, in line with organisations who are doing similar improves coordination and collaboration between agencies to reduce duplication of effort.

Political pressures – transparency and openness are becoming central to policy discussions in government, and IATI can be a way of delivering on commitments of openness and improving accountability.
