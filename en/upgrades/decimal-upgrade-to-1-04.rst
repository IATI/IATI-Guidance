The third decimal upgrade of the standard was proposed to occur
during the winter of 2013, but faced delays that meant the timetable had
to be revised. The process for doing so is outlined below.

Details about the specific changes are listed on the \ `knowledge
base <https://support.iatistandard.org/hc/en-us/categories/201849026-Upgrading-the-IATI-Standards>`__ in the \ `1.04 Decimal
Upgrade
