Key considerations
==================

By publishing data with the **IATI Standard**, organisations are committing to provide information that is accessible, useful and useable for a range of actors, particularly in partner countries. 
  
To ensure this, organisations are expected to consider that their IATI data is: 

* Timely - data is kept up-to-date and updated regularly
* Comprehensive - data represents a significant amount of activity
* Forward-looking - data can be used for indicative purposes
* Structured - data is valid in line with the Standard schema and rules
* Comparable - data can be linked across publishers through codelists and shared references
* Open - data is appropriately licensed and hosted

The **Key Considerations** section provides further guidance on each of these, and provides links to information, tools and materials, where appropriate.
