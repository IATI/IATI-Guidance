Definition
----------
When publishing IATI data, organisations should consider how to achieve the following:

* Registered - IATI data should be logged and linked to from the IATI Registry.
* Accessible - IATI data should be maintained, hosted and serviced as “open data”.
* Licenced - IATI data should be published under a relevant open licence.


Considerations
--------------
When providing *open* IATI data, publishers should also consider:

* The IATI Registry does not host data - it links to data that is held elsewhere, usually on a publisher's own website. It is the responsibility of publishers to maintain and publish their data in an accessible way.
* Data linked to from the IATI Registry should not contain any barriers to access - such as passwords.
* Data linked to the IATI Registry should be in XML, the format for IATI data.
* A wide variety of licences are applicable to IATI data.

Benefits
--------
It’s useful to access *open* IATI data because:

* When IATI data is linked to the IATI Registry, it makes it easier for users to locate and use it.
* When IATI data is openly licensed, it ensures that data users can legally utilise it.
