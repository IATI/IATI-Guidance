Non-Embedded Codelist Changelog
===============================

Non-embedded codelists are ‘non-functional’ codelists, that usually provide lookup information on e.g. currencies, languages in use, countries, etc. Often they are derived from third party lists and an addition or modification has a minor impact on the sense and use of the data.  

This page details any additions of changes to Non-embedded codelists.  Further information on `how IATI codelists are  managed <http://iatistandard.org/codelists/codelist-management/>`__.
