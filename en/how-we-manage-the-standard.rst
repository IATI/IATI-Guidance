The IATI standard is a living entity that will require improvement over time.

The standard is a collection of XML schema, core codelists, non-core codelists, documentation and rules.

Changes to some or all of those parts of the standard will be driven by the suggestions and experiences of the publishers and users of IATI data. Minor (previously decimal) upgrades can be initiated by the `Governing Board <https://iatistandard.org/en/about/governance/who-runs-iati/>`__, following advice from the TAG Chair and the Technical Lead. Major upgrades can be initiated by the `Members’ Assembly <https://iatistandard.org/en/about/join-iati/members-assembly/>`__, following the advice from the Governing Board.

Any member of the IATI community can make a proposal (via `IATI Discuss <https://discuss.iatistandard.org/c/standard-management>`__), and each upgrade process will receive its own forum where proposals can be assigned. The forums allow for a public exchange on the merits of the proposals to take place.

The current process for upgrading the standard (details below) was agreed at the `2017 Members’ Assembly <https://iatistandard.org/documents/242/Paper-10-Proposed-revisions-to-the-IATI-Standard-upgrade-process.pdf>`__. For the previous upgrade process please see the `Previous Upgrade Process <http://iatistandard.org/upgrades/all-versions/previous-process>`__ page.

Details of how the IATI codelists are managed are here (add in link).

Note: The current standard upgrade process will follow the widely-adopted `Semantic Versioning specification <https://semver.org/>`__ at the next major upgrade.
