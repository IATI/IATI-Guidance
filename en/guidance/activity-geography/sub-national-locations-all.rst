     - Specifies whether the location is where the activity is happening or where the intended beneficiaries live.
     - This can only be published once.

       The value must be on the `geographic location reach <http://reference.iatistandard.org/codelists/GeographicLocationReach/>`__ codelist.

   * - `location-id <http://reference.iatistandard.org/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/location/location-id/>`__
     - A unique code describing the location according to a recognised gazetteer or repository of administrative boundaries.
     - The must come from one of the lists on the `geographic vocabulary <http://reference.iatistandard.org/codelists/GeographicVocabulary/>`__ codelist.
