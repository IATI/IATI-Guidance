The IATI standard is a living entity that will require improvement over
time. 

The standard is a collection of XML schema, embedded codelists, 
non-embedded codelists, documentation and rules.

Changes to some or all of those parts of the standard will be driven by 
the suggestions and experiences of the publishers and users of IATI 
data, and managed by the IATI Steering Committee through its Secretariat
and Technical Advisory Group.

Some changes can be made at any time without having a major effect on 
data publishers or data users. These are known as:

<!-- Propose we stick with Decimal and Integer and stop talking about major and minor.
re-use minor to talk about between upgrade changes-->

Minor Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Minor changes can be made without changing the version of the standard. 
They cover:

-  bug-fixes

-  modifications to non-embedded codelists

-  improvements to documentation

Minor changes can be tracked through the `IATI GitHub <https://github.com/IATI>`__ account


More significant changes to the standard are handled via upgrades. 
There are two types of upgrades:

Decimal Upgrades
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

****Decimal**** Upgrades (e.g. from 1.01 to 1.02) will
cover:

-  bug-fixes

-  modifications to embedded codelists

-  minor additions to the standard which improve the functionality
   without introducing substantial new content

-  changes will be optional

-  changes will be backwardly compatible.

Integer Upgrades
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

****Integer**** Upgrades (e.g. from 1.x to 2.x) will
cover

-  substantial additions involving new areas of data

-  new mandatory fields

-  changes that are not backwardly compatible

-  proposed minor upgrades that are disputed by one or more signatories.

Open Consultation on all proposed changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All proposed changes, for Integer and Decimal Upgrades, will be published on the
IATI Knowledge Base
(`http://support.iatistandard.org/forums <http://support.iatistandard.org/forums>`__) in the `IATI Standards forums <http://support.iatistandard.org/categories/20001338-The-IATI-Standards>`_.

The entire process should be open to public scrutiny at all times.

Anyone can make a proposal (via the `Modifications, Additions, Improvements section <http://support.iatistandard.org/forums/20020808-modifications-additions-improvements>`_), and each upgrade process receives it's own forum where proposals can be assigned. The forums allow for a public exchange on the merits of the proposals to take place. The TAG Secretariat will
contribute to these exchanges and will draft proposals for the formal formats required for the standard.

Minor Changes may take place with our without wider consultation. You can
suggest a minor change directly to support@iatistandard.org

If you wish to discuss an idea before submitting a proposal you may wish to consult the `IATI Technical Mailing List <http://wiki.iatistandard.org/community/mailing_list>`_ first.

Decimal Upgrade Procedures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clear cut off dates for proposals to be considered for a Decimal Upgrade
will be advertised on the `IATI Standard website <http://iatistandard.org/>`__
<!-- do we want to be more explicit and say Upgrades-->
The TAG Secretariat will select those proposals meeting
the above mentioned guidelines and prepare a proposed decimal upgrade.
The contents of this proposed upgrade will be published on the Knowledge
Base and all signatories and publishers of IATI data will be informed of
its contents by email. 

A timetable governing a process of consultation and implementation of 
the changes will be published. 

Objections, improvements, observations etc. will be addressed throughout 
the upgrade process.

Integer Upgrade Procedures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The timing and planning for an Integer Upgrade will be approved by the
Steering Committee. All proposed changes will be fully documented and
circulated to all signatories. A timetable for the upgrade process will 
be available on the `IATI Standard website <http://iatistandard.org/>`__
<!-- do we want to be more explicit and say Upgrades-->

Consultation, and progress on the upgrade will be available in public via
IATI websites.

Integer upgrades will require the formal consent of signatories.
<!-- signatories? Should be members?-->
