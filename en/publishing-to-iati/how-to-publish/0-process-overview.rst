Process Overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is an introductory guide to organisations who want to publish their data to IATI. It is built on the experience of those organisations who have already published data, and the experience of the IATI TAG Secretariat in supporting organisations to publish.

The publishing process involves the following steps:

- :ref:`prepare_your_org` - What resources will you need to publish and what sorts of issues should be considered when moving to become transparent?
- Establishing Publishing Policies - Decide who, what, when and how information will be published.
- Data Considerations - Issues to consider when deciding what specific data fields will be published.
- Selecting A Publishing Tool - How to decide what publishing tool is the best choice to use for publishing.
