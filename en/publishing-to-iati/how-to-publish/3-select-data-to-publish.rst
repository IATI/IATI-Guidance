Data Considerations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


When working towards publication, it is important to know what data you have available as an organisation and the quality of this data. The focus is very much on publishing what you can, based on what is readily available, ensuring it is of reasonable quality, and also taking into account any exclusions. The idea is to then continually improve over time.



Deciding What Data To Publish
=============================

Publish should try and consider publishing data for all fields of the IATI Standard. However, it is recognised that some elements will not be relevant to all organisations or information in some areas may need to be excluded for reasons of security of confidentiality.



Data Availability
=================

IATI recognises that an organisation is unlikely to have all of the information set out in the IATI Standard available for immediate publication. An organisation can therefore work with whatever information they currently have available with the aim of adding to this as they progress through the IATI process. The Implementation Schedule allows organisations to identify what information is available for immediate publication, what is only partially publishable (e.g. may require further information to be added in before reaching full compliance), and what will be published at a future date. It also enables organisation to state what data is not available, whether this is due to exclusions or it not being applicable to the organisation for example, and what is not currently captured but could be considered for publication at some stage.
 
The availability of data will also depend on how information is currently captured and stored – i.e. does it need to be drawn from different places to meet IATI requirements? Delays in publishing beyond what is immediately available could therefore be due to having to put new systems in place to integrate data capture mechanisms.



DFID Minimum Requirements (UK NGOs and their Partners)
======================================================

If you are a DFID grantee then you need to make sure that you inclue all the fields that have been designated as mandatory by DFID. The list of these fields is at
