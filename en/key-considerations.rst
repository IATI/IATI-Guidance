Key Considerations
==================

Definition
----------
| Good quality data is more useable and gives a clearer and more comprehensive picture of a Publisher's activities. 
|
| By publishing data with the **IATI Standard**, organisations are committing to provide information that is accessible, useful and useable for a range of actors, particularly in partner countries. 
| 
| To ensure this, organisations are expected to consider the following in their IATI publication:

1. Timely - data is kept up-to-date
2. Comprehensive - data represents a significant amount of activity
3. Forward-looking - data can be used for indicative purposes
4. Well-formed - data is valid in line with the standard
5. Interoperable - data can be linked across publishers
6. Available openly - data is appropiately licenced and hosted
