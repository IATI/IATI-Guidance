Structured
==========

Definition
----------
When publishing IATI data, organisations should consider how to achieve the following:

* Format - IATI data should be formatted correctly as well-formed XML
* Valid - IATI data should pass the relevant IATI schema validation
* Rules - IATI data should satisfy the relevant Ruleset that provides additional conditions and logic.


Considerations
--------------
When providing *structured* IATI data, publishers should also consider:

* XML is the chosen technical markup language of IATI - it is vital that published data meets the minimum requirement of “well-formed XML”.
* Schema validation is very important to ensure - IATI has different versions of the standard from which to operate.
* The Standard Ruleset enable additional logic in IATI data - such as the ordering of dates within data, and the formation of identifiers.


Benefits
--------
It’s useful to access *structured* IATI data because:

* When IATI data is well-formed,  it can be more easily accessed and utilised in conjunction with other published IATI datasets.
