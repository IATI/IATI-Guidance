Select A Publishing Tool
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are currently three different mechanisms available to convert data into IATI- XML data files 


Aidstream
=========

Aidstream (www.aidstream.org)  is an online management tool which you use by manually entering all of the relevant activity information through the use of drop-down menus and text boxes. Aidstream converts the data entered into XML and outputs both organisation and activity datafiles for publishing . The data stored in Aidstream can be added to or amended at any point. Aidstream is usually the tool of choice if you only have a small number of activities (approx < 15 - 20) to publish.

Specific guidance on the use of Aidstream can be found at http://support.iatistandard.org/entries/27374208-AidStream-Guidance


CSV Converter 
=============

The CSV Convertor tool (http://www.csv2iati.iatistandard.org)  enables relevant activity information to be pulled from across the organisation into a single templated file. Data for each activity is stored in a single row in a CSV file with column headings mapping to IATI fields .

Once the CSV file is completed, it is uploaded to the conversion tool and a mapping model is created. Column titles from the CSV file are mapped to IATI fields so that information is picked up from the correct place. Default values for some fields can also be set. Once the mapping exercise is completed, you simply click to convert the data and the tool creates an Activity file (no organisation file) for publishing..

Bespoke (In House Applications)
===============================

The option exists  to develop internal systems and processes so that data is pulled together from internal management and finance systems to create XML data. This requires technical knowledge of both XML and the organisation's internal systems in order to create a programme to achieve this. This can be done with either internal technical expertise or by bringing in consultants to develop a bespoke package. 

This is normally an option often chosen by large organisations reporting a large number of activities, as in the long-run this proves more cost effective means of reporting to IATI.
