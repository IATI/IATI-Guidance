Process Overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


This is an introductory guide to organisations who want to publish their data to IATI. It is built on the experience of those organisations who have already published data, and the experience of the IATI TAG Secretariat in supporting organisations to publish.

The objective of the IATI publishing process is to enable any publishing organisation to produce the following regularly updated set of information products:

- IATI XML Organisation File
- One or more IATI XML Activity File(s)
- IATI Registry Account
- Implementation Schedule (optional but recommended that publishers complete)



IATI XML Datafiles
==================

Publishing to IATI requires the creation of the following XML datafiles. 

- An Organisation File
- One or more Activity File

Organisation File
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

As its name suggest the Organisation files contains information about the publishing organisation. Information includes the organisation’s:

- Name and unique IATI identifier
- Planned future annual total budgets
- Planned future budgets for aid given to recipient countries
- Planned future budgets for aid given to recipient organisations
- Official public documents.

Activity File(s)
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

The IATI Activity file contains information about an organisation's aid activities. Information about an aid activity may include:

- The name and description of the activity
- Who is involved, and what is their role
- Where is the activity geographically
- When is/did the activity taking place
- What documents help us find out more?
- How is the activity classified and categorised?
- What financial transactions have been made for this activity
- How successful or not was the activity. Did it achieve its objectives?

It is recommended that published files should not be larger than 10mb in size. If a publisher has a large number of activities it is also recommended that files are segmented by country eg all activities taking place in Ethiopia are contained within a discrete Activity file. 

 
 
The Implementation Schedule
===========================

The purpose of the Implementation Schedule is to:
- Document an organisation's publishing policies to provide context to its published datafiles
- Provide the time line for when data for each field of the IATI Standard was / will be published (or not published if not applicable / possible etc.)
- Enable the IATI Secretariat to confirm that an organisation is delivering on its publishing commitment.

The Implementation Schedule (currently in MS Excel format) is a living document (and should ideally be subject to the version control) which can be updated and added to at any time, to reflect changes or additions to the way an organisation is reporting. It is produced to document how, what and when an organisation is reporting to IATI. 
The drafting of the Implementation Schedule can be done in parallel with preparing data for publication and it should also be published along side the IATI data. Whilst the IMplementation Schedule is not a mandatory document to create, it is strongly recommended that it is used in order to aid the publisher in publishing their data.

IATI Registry Account
=====================

All IATI publishers must have an account on the IATI Registry at http://www.iatiregistry.org/. The Registry is an index of data files published in compliance with the standards of the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI). It does not contain the actual data, only links to the published data, and metadata describing the contents of these files.When a publisher is close to publishing for the first time they should create an account on the IATI Registry. Once the account has been 'approved' by the IATI Secritariat the publishing organisation can add details of the location of their IATI XML datafiles. Once this has been done the publisher can consider themselves as having successfully published.
