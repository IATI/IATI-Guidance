Available openly
================

Definition
----------

* In the IATI context, available data is data that is accessible and open for users.
* The IATI Registry does not host data - it links to data that is held elsewhere, usually on a publisher's own website. It is the responsibility of publishers to maintain and publish their data in an accessible way.
* Accessible data should be physically available for users to find and use, but also appropriately licenced.
* When data is accessible, it is easier for users to locate it and make use of it.
