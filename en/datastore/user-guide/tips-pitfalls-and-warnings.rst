Tips, pitfalls and warnings
===========================

Warning! The Datastore is not a single dataset

A single activity may be reported by a donor, an implementing agent and an aid information management system or other secondary source publisher.

Care thus needs to be taken in combining data from different sources.

- Comprehensiveness
- Duplication and Double Counting
- Publisher Profiles
- Timeliness and Frequency of updates
- Downloading the complete database?
