Comparable
==========

Definition
----------
When publishing IATI data, organisations should consider how to achieve the following:

* Codelists - IATI data should include codes that are published on the relevant IATI codelists.
* Identifiers - IATI data should reference organisations involved in any activity in a structured way, using organisation identifiers.
* Traceable - IATI data should reference IATI data published by other organisations, particularly if funds are being transferred between organisations.


Considerations
--------------
When providing *comparable* IATI data, publishers should also consider:

* The IATI codelists cover a wide range of fields and values.  Where relevant, these are derived from existing codelists, maintained by external agencies.
* When describing organisations, it is desirable to included a structured reference (organisation identifier) rather than just the name.  Guidance is available on how to construct these.
* Often it is the case that organisations share activity information via regular communication channels, to ensure that cross-references can be made within the data.


Benefits
--------
Itâ€™s useful to access *comparable* IATI data because:

* When IATI data contains common codes, it can more easily be utilised in conjunction with other IATI datasets.
* When IATI data includes structured identifiers, it can assist users to understand who/what is being referenced. 
* When IATI data is interoperable, it enables users to trace funds through the resource chain.
