Establish Organisational Commitment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Gain Senior Management Commitment
=================================

Whatever the incentives of an organisation for publishing IATI data, it is important that these are understood and supported by senior management and other staff throughout the organisation. IATI does involve an investment of resources to be a success and it is important for senior management of an organisation or agency to recognise this and to ensure staff capacity is made available.


Establish IATI POC as a Permanent Role 
======================================

As publishing to IATI is an ongoing function it is important to define the responsibility for IATI publishing a permanent function within the orgnisation that must be allocated to a specific member of staff. This may herefore require updates to job descriptions, personal development plans etc as required by your HR processes



Create Your Project Team
========================

In order to implement IATI sustainably within an organisation, many organisations form a working group or project team  to bring together all the relevant parts of the organisation. In most situations this group is formed early in the process of working on IATI implementation, to integrate the ideas and practical plans for publishing IATI data.
The teams are generally made up by staff from the following areas:

Programmes
Finance
IT and Information Management
Legal

The team ensures that the detailed processes for capturing and publishing data are properly integrated and function smoothly throughout an organisation, bringing together different departments. They might also engage in communicating the work that they to to the rest of the organisation in order to increase awareness of transparency, for example promoting the importance of writing documents, keeping in mind that they may be published in the public domain, rather than remain internal. The focus was on changing the mindset of staff in their everyday work, rather than viewing IATI as another reporting mechanism.
