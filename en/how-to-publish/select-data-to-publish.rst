Data considerations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Deciding what data to publish can be aided by filling out the Organisation and Activity tabs of the Implementation Schedule.


The Role Of the IATI Standard
=============================

The IATI Standard is fundamental to the publishing process because the it provides the specification for how data must be formatted for IATI publishing. 

The IATI Standard has two components:

The Organisation Standard - which provides the definition for what data can be included and how it must be formatted for the Organisation file
The Activity Standard - which provides the definition for what data can be included and how it must be formatted for an Activity file

The IATI Standard is managed by the IATI Secretariat and anyone can request amendments or changes to the IATI Standard via the IATI Standard Upgrade process - see http://iatistandard.org/upgrades .



Deciding What Data To Publish
=============================

When working towards publication, it is important to know what data you have available as an organisation and the quality of this data. The focus is very much on publishing what you can, based on what is readily available, ensuring it is of reasonable quality, and also taking into account any exclusions. The idea is to then continually improve over time.

Publishers should try and consider publishing data for all fields of the IATI Standard. However, it is recognised that some elements will not be relevant to all organisations or information in some areas may need to be excluded for reasons of security or confidentiality.

IATI recognises that an organisation is unlikely to have all of the information set out in the IATI Standard available for immediate publication. An organisation can therefore work with whatever information they currently have available with the aim of adding to this as they progress through the IATI process. 

The 'Organisation' and Activity' tabs of the Implementation Schedule allows organisations to identify what information is available for immediate publication, what is only partially publishable (e.g. may require further information to be added in before reaching full implementation), and what will be published at a future date. It also enables organisation to state what data is not available, whether this is due to exclusions or it not being applicable to the organisation for example, and what is not currently captured but could be considered for publication at some stage.
 
The availability of data will also depend on how information is currently captured and stored – i.e. does it need to be drawn from different places to meet IATI requirements? Delays in publishing beyond what is immediately available could therefore be due to having to put new systems in place to integrate data capture mechanisms.




DFID Minimum Requirements (UK NGOs and their Partners)
======================================================

If you are a DFID grantee then you need to make sure that you include all the fields that have been designated as mandatory by DFID. The list of these fields is at http://support.iatistandard.org/entries/21477271-DFID-Requirements-for-NGOs
