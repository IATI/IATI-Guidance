Process Overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is an introductory guide for organisations who want to publish their data to IATI. It is built on the experience of those organisations who have already published data and the experience of the IATI Secretariat in supporting organisations to publish.



Process Steps
=============

The publishing process involves the following steps:

- :ref: 'prepare_your_org' - What resources will you need to publish and what sorts of issues should be considered when moving to become more transparent?
- Establishing publishing policies - Decide who, what, when and how information will be published.
- Data considerations - Issues to consider when deciding what specific data fields from the IATI Standard will be published.
- Selecting a publishing tool - How to decide what publishing tool is the best choice to use for publishing.
- Producing the data files - Making sure appropriate change and quality control procedures are in place.
- Publishing the data files - Updating the IATI Registry and hosting of the data files.
- Regular update of data - Once published, how information should be regularly updated.
