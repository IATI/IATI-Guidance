Comprehensive
=============

Definition
----------
When publishing IATI data, organisations should consider how to achieve the following:

* Coverage - IATI data should represent a significant proportion of the development cooperation activities undertaken by the organisation.
* Scope - IATI data should cover as many of the relevant fields outlined in the standard as possible.
* Sense - IATI data should be represented in units that are manageable for the publisher and meaningful for the user - particularly when focusing on aggregation of transaction data.


Considerations
--------------
When providing *comprehensive* IATI data, publishers should also consider:

* Organisations can state the scope and scale of their IATI publication in an Implementation Schedule.
* Exclusions and redactions can be made for a variety of reasons, usually security of personnel or property, or for reasons of client or commercial confidentiality.
* Expenditure data in a lot of detail- such as an individual train journey or cup of coffee - may be best avoided in IATI transactions.  Many publishers aggregate expenditure items around certain cost areas, and by monthly/quarterly timeframes.

Benefits
--------
Itâ€™s useful to access *comprehensive* IATI data because:

* When IATI data is comprehensive, users of information can gain a fuller picture of the extent of development cooperation happening in different locations around the world.
