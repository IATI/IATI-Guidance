Regularly Updating Your Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you have initially published your first data sets you need to ensure that they are updated regularly. 



Updating Your Datafiles
=======================

The most important point about publishing regularly is to ensure that your data files are updated. Publishers should NOT create additional new files that only contain the most recent information each time they publish . 

Ideally all the information that relates to a specific activity should be kept together as much as is possible as this makes the ultimate use of the data by any third party much more efficient. Data should be cumulative (e.g. if publishing every quarter, the new files will include the quarter being reported on, and the previous quarter reported last time, and so on). It will also enable amendments to be made to existing data.

No data should ever be removed or deleted from published files. It is intended that one published data remains permanently available.

You will need to refer to the specific guidance of the tool that you are using to publish in order to  find out how to update pre-existing datasets
