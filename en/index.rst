IATI Standard Guidance
======================

Find guidance on how to publish and interpret data on specific topics according to the IATI Standard.

Each guidance page covers a different topic within the IATI Standard, for example activities budgets, geography, and document links. Find:

- an overview of why the data is useful and
- what elements or attributes can be published for each topic
- the associated rules and guidance for publishing or using data within the topic

Most guidance pages have recently been created through a consultation process (first published in 2019) and the IATI Technical Team is working to update older guidance pages. The ‘last updated date’ will tell you when the latest change was made. If you have any feedback, you can directly raise them on Github. Feedback will be reviewed every 6 months and pages updated if needed. For more information about these pages see [title of webpage/section].

To help you locate a guidance page, type keywords into the search bar. You can also filter by activity and organisation file.  If you cannot find what you are looking for, please email the IATI Technical Team at support@iatistandard.org.
