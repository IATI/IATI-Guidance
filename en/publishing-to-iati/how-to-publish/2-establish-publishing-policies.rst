Establish Publishing Policies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Once your organisation has committed to IATI publishing and the project team or IATI Champion is in place decisions need to be made about what, how and when data will be published. This
information is recorded on the 'Publishing Information' tab of the Implementation Schedule.


What Will Be Your Activity Unit of Aid? 
=======================================

One of the most important decisions to be taken before you start implementing IATI is to decide how to present your particular business model in a way in which your work is best translated into an IATI activity. It is up to you to define your units of aid and you can specify any number of hierarchical levels in which to best organise your activities. Your work might, for example, be broken into themes, programmes, projects, sub-projects and/or contracts. It is up to you to decide whether a hierarchical structure best tells the story of your organisation, or whether such a framework is irrelevant to the data that IATI is asking you to report.It is important to define what the unit of aid being reported is. Organisations use a range of different definitions or may have different ways of identifying an 'activity'. Examples of units of aid include: programmes, projects, sub-projects, activities, grants, etc.

If Units of aid are defined via a hierarchy, an explanation needs to be provided on how the units of aid are split between the hierarchy levels. For example, activities at hierarchy level 1 (or the parent level) could cover things like programmes, umbrella projects or grant streams. Units of aid at hierarchy level 2 (or 'child' level) could include projects or sub-projects. It is also possible for activities to be related on a horizontal basis ('siblings'). For example, a group of projects sitting under a programme could be classed as sibling activities. Related activities can be identified through providing the related activity identifiers when reporting on each individual activity.

It is also important to differentiate what data will appear at the different levels. For example, activity budgets could be reported at level 1, while transaction level data is reported at level 2. This also helps to avoid double counting, with monetary amounts being reported at the lowest possible hierarchical level (and not repeated or aggregated at higher levels). Lower level activities will inherit data from their parent activity.
 

Publishing Frequency
=====================

Organisations may typically publish updates annually, every 6 months, quarterly, monthly and even daily. Ideally IATI would want every publisher to publish as frequently as their information changes. However, IATI recognises that this is not always possible so it encourages publishers to select the most frequent publishing frequently that their organisation is able to support.


Data Timeliness
===============

Timeliness of data relates to how current the data is when it is published. IATI differs from other reporting standards and systems, by emphasising the importance of publishing timely data, that is reflective of the swift-changing nature of projects and activities. With this comes a tension between provision of timely data and quality data.

If you are publishing quarterly do you included transactions that have occurred right up to the day that you publish your information or are your most recent transaction those that occurred a month or so in the past? Timeliness is normally constrained to the accessibility and functioning of an organization's own accounting processes and systems. 


Data Quality
============

it is important to consider how accurate your data is when it is published. The data published does not need to be audited in the same way as would be done with close of year accounts. However, ultimately, the decision on data quality will be taken by each individual organisation, depending on the internal procedures and processes that data may have to go through before being put in the public domain. It will also depend on whether an organisation approaches IATI as an open data initiative or a process for publishing verified statistics. Many organisations publish information taken from unaudited accounts throughout the year that is then revised and republished once the accounts have been through the audit process. Is your data derived from estimated or actual figures or estimated or actual planning information. If data is initially published in an unvalidated format it is important to consider how and when your data can be recreated and published in its formalised format.

publishers to outline the quality assurance processes or any details of their considerations around what they consider to be verified or unverified data, and where their IATI data sits on that scale.


Thresholds
==========

If applicable, some organisations may need to establish thresholds in terms of the value of activities or transactions that they are publishing. For example, an organisation who works on large projects costing thousands of dollars, they may wish only to publish projects over a particular value (for example $500).

Similarly, if an organisation generally only makes or receives transactions over a particular value, they may wish to aggregate all transactions, in-coming or out-going that are under a particular value, per organisation, per publication period.

As with exclusions, information on thresholds should be clearly published as part of the organisation’s registry record in order to help users of the data understand the context it is being published in.


Exclusions
==========

IATI enables publishers of information to the Standard to exclude certain information from their data. However IATI requires that the policy of how those exclusions are made is made public, as part of the Registry Record in order to provide context to those who are using the data. Reasons for needing to exclude data depend on each organisation but can vary from security concerns to the need to protect commercial information. If your organisation carries out works which could be considered by others as controversial or unethical eg. providing family planning services to people who live in catholic countries, education of girls within cultures that are seen as oppressive to women etc.,  you may not want to publish all the details of your work in order to both protect those who are doing the work as well as the intervention itself. Similarly if you are working in sensitive geographic areas you may not wish to publish details of your work and the areas in which it is taken place. In such circumstances you can elect to only publish minimal details or even to not publish any details at all.

Considerations when defining an exclusion policy

- Does your organisation/government have any existing Freedom of Information laws or policies that may impact the IATI exclusion policy?
- Are there particular data fields where you would consistently have to remove data?
- Are there entire programmes/activities that would need to be excluded from your IATI data?


Publishing Scope
================

Each organisation needs to understand where it sits within the Aid delivery supply chain and report accordingly. Basically an organisation needs to only report on activities for which they either receive payments or make payments for or are directly involved in in some other way


Where Will You Publish Your IATI Datafiles? 
===============================================

When you publish your information you do not give your information to IATI to look after. You will instead create an account on the IATI Registry that will hold (along with other information) the URL of where your IATI files are located. IATI therefore asks its publishers to host the datafiles that contain their IATI information on their 's own web servers. This is because data that is located within a publisher's own web space has greater integrity due to it being located at source. Therefore you will probably need to work with your IT or web team in order to identify a location where your IATI information can be hosted. If you have decided to create an IATI specific web page you might decide that it should include links to your IATI files?


Licensing 
=========

When you publish your information you will also need to license how that data can be used by third parties. You specify the licensing of the file within the information held on your IATI Registry account. As the intention of IATI is to make information freely available to anyone who wants to use it we recommend that you choose one of the following license types.

- Public domain no copyright, database rights, or contractual rights over the open aid information.

Open Data Policy For Your Organisation
=======================================

Having gone through the experience of considering what data can and cannot be openly published along with making decisions about how that is achieved, it is good practice to use the knowledge gained by the experience to produce an Open Data Policy for your organisation that should apply not just to IATI data but any data that is published externally.
