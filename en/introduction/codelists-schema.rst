Codelists, schema & rulesets
============================

Definition
----------

Within the **IATI Standard** there are a set of values, rules and constraints that should be considered by all publishers.  These are:

* Codelists - lists of values or codes permitted for certain IATI fields. 
* Schema - these describe the names of elements, structure of formats and other conditions. 
* Rulesets - additional logics and constraints, not evident in the schema


Considerations
--------------

* Codelists are managed to deal with additions, amendments, bugs, and deletions.
* IATI has a number of schemas for organisation, activity and common fields
* Reference to the relevant schema and codelists can be found in each Element page in both the organisation and activity standards
* The Standard Ruleset represents rules around date ordering and ``iati-identifier`` formatting
