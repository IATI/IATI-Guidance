Produce your datafiles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Having selected your publishing tool and identified from where your information to be published is derived, you will need to establish your processes for how your IATI data files are created. These should address not just the initial creation of files but also how the files will be regularly updated as per the publishing frequency that you have selected.
 


Establish who is responsible for creating and updating your files
=================================================================

It is essential that you make sure that everybody involved in creating and updating your data files knows what input is required from them and when. The IATI publisher may be tasked with updating the files but they are likely to need data provided from other areas within the organisation so it is important that those who may have to provide the data are also quite clear about what information is needed and when.




Establish a change control procedure 
====================================

Regardless of your publishing tool you should be able to tell who has updated your data sets and when. Therefore it is recommended that a change control process is established around the files that you publish.



 
Data quality control
====================

As you create your datafiles you may want to make sure that the quality of your data is as good as it can be by establishing a quality control mechanism

Aidstream users
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

If you are using Aidstream this is built into the publishing process of the tool. Once you have entered your data the tool requires the user to mark the data accordingly as it progresses through the stages of datafile creation which are:

EDIT -> COMPLETED -> VERIFIED -> PUBLISHED

Once a dataset is marked as 'completed' it is intended that another person should manually check the data that has been entered. The verifier should correct any errors that are found and then mark the data as 'Verified'

You will need to build quality control into your procedures as a separate step. Ideally, you might want to identify the most appropriate point in your processes where the data to be published can be checked by the most appropriate and qualified person.
