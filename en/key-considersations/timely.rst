Timely
======

Definition
----------
* When data is timely, a publisher is providing the most recently available data possible.
* The more timely data is, the more useful it is for users, particularly for partner country governments using it to inform forward planning. 
* Publishers should provide new and refreshed data as often as possible, ideally on a monthly or quarterly basis.
* Some publishers start publishing data on a six-monthly or annual basis and improve their frequency over time. Other publishers are updating their data files on a daily or weekly basis.
