Detailed specifications on the changes to the standard are published on the `IATI wiki <http://wiki.iatistandard.org/standard/revision/1.02/changes_specification?s[]=1&s[]=02>`__.

Documentation changes 
---------------------

On the IATI Standard documentation, the navigation and page URL for the Activity Standard has been changed. Previous versions included a nesting of pages around facets not used within the standard (Identification, Basic Activity Information, etc). The Activity Standard is now organised in a flatter structure, for ease of navigation. Additionally, the URL pattern has been edited to reflect the exact term for each element. For example:

| 1.01: Sector: http://iatistandard.org/103/101/activities-standard/classifications/general-detailed-sector/
| 1.02: http://iatistandard.org/103/activities-standard/sector/

A full `list of URL changes <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AqXcKmXbCG-OdEQ4S1JvLUNLWm9JaldEbDJYci1EVGc>`__ is available. All URLs have been automatically redirected where possible.
