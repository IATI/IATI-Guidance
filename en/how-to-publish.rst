How To Publish
==============

This is an introductory guide to organisations who want to understand the different elements of IATI implementation and the different data, policy and technical considerations that need to be taken into account. It is built on the experience of those organisations who have already published data, and the experience of the IATI TAG Secretariat in supporting organisations to publish.
